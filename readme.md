# Simulated Device Monitoring and Alert System

*Section:* 1-CpE-C

## Project Description
This program monitors simulated device temperature readings. It stores the readings in a list, accepts new valid readings, and classifies each one as NORMAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL. It also generates a numerical summary and an overall monitoring status. It was built as the Week 17 integrative project for CPP102.

## Features
- View all stored temperature readings
- Add a new reading (whole numbers from 0 to 100 only)
- Classify every reading as NORMAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL
- Generate a summary: number of readings, total, average, minimum, maximum, category counts and percentages, and overall status
- Reject invalid menu choices and invalid readings without crashing

## Requirements
- Python 3 (no external packages)

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal inside the Week17 folder.
2. Type: python device_monitor.py

   (On macOS or Linux, type: python3 device_monitor.py)

## Sample Output
MONITORING SUMMARY
------------------
Number of readings  : 5
Total of readings   : 160
Average temperature : 32.00 °C
Minimum temperature : 28 °C
Maximum temperature : 37 °C

NORMAL   : 2 (40.00%)
WARNING  : 2 (40.00%)
CRITICAL : 1 (20.00%)

Overall Status: ATTENTION REQUIRED

## Test Cases
I performed 10 tests. 10 passed and 0 failed. Full details are in [test_cases.md](test_cases.md).

## Known Limitations
- Readings are lost when the program closes, because nothing is saved to a file.
- Readings cannot be edited or deleted after they are added.
- The temperature limits (30 and 35) are fixed for this classroom simulation and are not real device-safety standards.


## Reflection
The hardest part of this project is not just the code, its also how to put everything in my GitHub account. It was a struggle for me because i forgot the process how to put my codes and files in the GitHub using CMD. and other issue is that the terminal cannot recognize the command when i try to Git push and pull the file and the code. Opening a terminal before installing something means it won’t recognize the new program, which is why I had to quit and relaunch VS Code. If I did this again, I’d make a commit at each milestone so the history grows naturally as I go, and I’d extend the program to store readings in a file so nothing disappears when it exits.
